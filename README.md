# smart-cli-editor
An open source, smart CLI editor.

This project is an excercise in learning. Vim, NeoVim and GNU Emacs are capable of all the features that are to be added in this project either in the base install or through the use of plugins. This project, however, lets us experiment with implementing the features in our own way using languages and techniques of interest to us.
